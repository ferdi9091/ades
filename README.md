Imgbot is a friendly robot that optimizes your images and saves you time. Optimized images mean smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality.  Shortly after installing Imgbot, you will receive a pull request with all of your images optimized. Just merge the pull request and youâ€™re done! As you work on your project, Imgbot works alongside you to keep your images optimized.  Imgbot uses lossless compression by default.
